	<p>Perfect you are in your creation<br />
	Great was your wisdom<br />

	Stood in garden of eden<br />
	Wore precious stones<br />
	Cherub who walked on the mountain of God<br />
	But your pride grew<br />
	Desire to be equals God<br />
	You've fallen in planet land<br /><br />


	In Flames, satan will burn<br />
	In Flames, for all Eternity<br /><br />

	Your intention is destroy<br />
	The creation of God<br />
	Deceitful snake crushed by<br />
	The feets of Nazarene<br />
	The Warriors of Jehovah<br />
	Will annihilate your reign<br />
	Towed in the lake of fire<br />
	Your condemnation is Eternal <br /><br /></p>

	<p>
	Memories, feelings, things of the past<br />
	The pain and suffering<br />
	Invade my soul, <br />
	My human nature, because of the anguish<br />
	Wishes to Die<br /><br />

	In these dark days, you take care of me<br /> 
	Your eyes see deeply my soul<br />
	Your reached out hands, offer help<br /><br />

	The sins and temptations<br />
	Separate me from from you<br />
	My pride said: "I don't need You"<br />
	I walked around the world, <br />
	Looking for answers<br />
	Abandoned, depressed, tired<br />
	You helped me<br /><br />

	He see your suffering<br />
	Reached out his hands<br />
	Do You accept ???<br /><br />

	<p><strong>04. The Cross is Empty</strong></p>
	<p>
	I see one Hill, one man too<br />
	Carring one heavy cross<br />
	I think, which is his mistake,<br /> 
	What kind of crime did He commit<br />
	Alone to rise the hill, <br />
	walking for His death<br />
	I don't understand, <br />
	The reason of the rage of crowd<br />
	So the man is innocent<br /><br />

	In the cross, I see one Man,<br />
	By His side, two criminals<br />
	His hands, his feets naileds<br />
	What is his end ?<br /><br />

	His scream of pain,<br /> 
	Makes the earth quake<br />
	The sky is dark<br />
	The people in desperantion<br />
	The time passes<br />
	I see,<br />
	His body is not on the cross<br />
	Or in the tomb to perish, <br />
	This Man over the death Triumphed<br />
	In the third day He revived<br /><br />

	The Cross is Empty<br />
	The Grave is Empty<br />
	The Cross is Empty<br />
	In sign of Victory<br /><br />
	</p>

	<p><strong>05. Out of Hell</strong></p>
	<p>
	
	The Shadows guided my way<br />
	The depression invaded my own<br />
	I was jailed in the claws of evil<br />
	Needed a solution<br/>
	Alucinations in my mind<br />
	The fear crushed my freedom<br />
	But one day, By the blood<br />
	From the fire of hell, i was saved<br /><br />

	Out of Hell, by the blood<br />
	Blood of Jesus Christ<br /><br />

	Now, i think and try to imagine<br />
	The sacrifice on the the Cross<br />
	All the pain an a only man<br />
	The pouring blood, was the price of the sin<br />
	The cross on the calvary, the extreme suffering<br />
	Anguish, loliness, pain, his death brought life to me<br />

	The great proof of Love: The Sacrifice on the Cross<br /><br />

	Out of Hell, By the love<br />
	Love of father for your creation<br /><br />
	</p>

	<p><strong>01. Black Feelings of Mind</strong></p>	
	<p>

	Lifes under opression<br />	
	Malign spiritual forces<br />	
	Dominate opress minds<br />	
	Diabolical desires<br />	
	Souls reaping by suicide<br />	
	Journey without return<br />	
	For eternal suffering<br />	<br />	

	Black Feelings of Mind<br />	
	The Master of light will destroy<br />	<br />	

	Guided by lies, <br />	
	Vain promises<br />	
	Believing to be the solution<br />	
	Obscure voices of darkness<br />	
	Voices speaking lies<br />	
	Suicide in not solution<br />	<br />
